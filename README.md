# Common Faults With CTEK Battery Chargers

Over the past few years I have been using a CTEK MXS 7.0 battery charger to trickle charge and recondition relativly small batteries (7Ah- 40Ah).

Unfortunately while reconditioning an old 100A battery (the charger does support this)... the **relay started short clicking** and the **Mode button stopped working**.

I opened the device and noticed a weird smell upon inspection.. 3 large 2200uf capacitors on the DC output were swollen and 2 were vented.

They use 16v caps on the DC output like planned obsolescence beta cucks...

Those caps should be at least 25v!! 16v is too low in my opinion always run them at around 50% - 60% of the rated voltage (Around 14.5v is the highest constant voltage in this case!!!) even if they are 105Â°C caps they will fail again in time. 

Unfortunately there's limited space but I was able to get 3300uf 16v squeezed in and I soldered a glass fuse holder replacing the 30A blade fuse (using 10A fuse) just in case.

The button was cleaned with alcohol and the button cap twisted around a bit. Suddenly it was working again...

A successfull repair, however I will replace thoses 16v with 25v caps once my order arrives.
